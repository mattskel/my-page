Can easily add react to an existing project by adding the script tags to the <body>
React is just a language used to describe a user interface. You dont need node to run react, however 

node is a popular platform to run a web server that can host react apps

You can initialise your project with node using npm init
If node has been installed globally, you wont see a node_modules folder
